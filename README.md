# Liar's Dice

Simulation of Liar's Dice game with optimal policy implementation.

## Overview

This project implements a Liar's Dice game simulator where Player 1 uses an optimal probability-based policy and Player 2 uses a truth-telling policy. The mathematical formulation and optimal policy details are documented in [`MATH.md`](./MATH.md).

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.13.6
- OPTIONAL: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager

## Running

Run a single game simulation:

```bash
uv run main.py
python3 run main.py
python run main.py
```

## Math

See [`MATH.md`](./MATH.md) for the mathematical formulation, state space definitions, and optimal policy calculations.

## Disclaimer

- The Math and Code were both developed using AI agent assistance. Prompts can be found within the `prompts/` folder.
